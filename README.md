# Generalised-Linear-regression

In order to best fit a non-linear curve to the data, we figure out how close is the set of predicted values to the set of given values for the response variable, just like in simple linear regression. The only additional thing we need to do is to pick the right features or functions of raw attributes and run a regression on features instead running it on raw attributes.
