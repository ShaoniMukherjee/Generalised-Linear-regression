# Generalised-Linear-regression

In order to best fit a non-linear curve to the data, we figure out how close is the set of predicted values to the set of given values for the response variable, just like in simple linear regression. The only additional thing we need to do is to pick the right features or functions of raw attributes and run a regression on features instead running it on raw attributes.

The generalised regression, we attempt to model the data using 'derived features', which could be linear or non-linear, rather than the original raw attributes. Specifically, you will learn to:

Differentiate between linear regression and generalised regression frameworks
Extend the linear regression framework to generalised regression problems 
Extract and use derived features for building generalised regression models
